## English roast 







Your attention span is so short you probably forgot why you clicked on this thread halfway through the title.



You don’t have a hobby; you have a scrolling addiction with a side of dopamine exhaustion.



If I wrote this as a paragraph, you’d need a "Subway Surfers" gameplay video at the bottom just to finish it.



Your internal monologue has been replaced by the "Oh No" song on a loop.



You’re the reason instructions for shampoo now include pictures.



You’ve scrolled past more content today than your ancestors saw in their entire lives, and you still can’t name one thing you learned.



Your gray matter is basically just a sponge for 7-second audio clips.



You don’t read books; you wait for the "3-minute summary" and then lose interest at 45 seconds.



If your life were a movie, you’d try to skip to the end after the opening credits.



You have the cognitive endurance of a goldfish on caffeine.



The Lifestyle Critique

Your "Screen Time" report is a cry for help that even God is ignoring.



You’ve developed a thumb callous just to watch people dance poorly to sped-up songs.



Your bed isn’t a place for sleep; it’s a charging station for your terminal scrolling habit.



You’ve seen 4,000 "hacks" for your life and haven't implemented a single one.



Your sense of humor is now strictly dictated by whatever sound effect is currently trending.



You’ve spent three hours watching people restock their fridges instead of cleaning your own room.



You think you’re "informed" because you saw a 60-second clip of a podcast bro lying to you.



You’re one "low battery" warning away from a complete psychological collapse.



Your attention span is the reason movies now have to have an explosion every four minutes.



You’ve forgotten how to be bored, which is why you’ve also forgotten how to be creative.



Deep Cuts

You scroll to avoid your thoughts, but your thoughts are starting to sound like TikTok transitions.



You’d swipe up on your own funeral if the eulogy took longer than a minute.



Your dopamine receptors are fried harder than a state fair Snickers bar.



You look at a 10-minute YouTube video and think, "Who has the time?" before scrolling for three hours.



You’ve "saved" 500 recipes you will never cook and 200 workouts you will never do.



You’re the target audience for "Wait for it..." videos that never actually deliver.



Your personality is just a collage of the last five creators you watched.



You can’t even sit through a 30-second microwave timer without checking your phone.



If you spent half as much time working as you do scrolling, you’d be your own boss by now.



Your brain is essentially a graveyard for memes that died three weeks ago.



The Brutal Finish

You’re not "relaxing"; you’re just rotting in high definition.



You’ve replaced your personality with a series of reaction emojis.



Your attention span is so cooked, you probably didn't even notice I skipped the punchline on number 27. (I didn't, but you had to check, didn't you?)



You think a 2-minute "deep dive" makes you an expert on geopolitics.



You’ve seen the world through a 6-inch screen and wonder why you feel claustrophobic.



Your eyes are permanently adjusted to "portrait mode."



You’re addicted to the "infinite scroll" because your real life doesn’t have a "For You" page.



You probably have five tabs open right now and you’re ignoring all of them for this.



Your attention span is the shortest thing about you—and that’s saying a lot.



You’ve watched 100 "productivity tips" while laying in bed at 3:00 AM.



You’re basically a biological remote control.



If a video doesn't have subtitles in Comic Sans, you can't understand it.



You think "POV" means whatever you want it to mean at this point.



You’ve lost the ability to have a conversation that doesn't start with "Did you see that one video...?"



Your thumb has more muscle mass than your legs.



You’re the reason the "skip" button was invented.



You’d rather watch a video of someone living their life than actually live yours.



You’re a dopamine junkie whose dealer is an algorithm designed by a 22-year-old in Silicon Valley.



Your brain is currently running on 1% battery and "skibidi" logic.



You’ve reached the end of the list. Congratulations. That’s the most reading you’ve done since 2022.

I’m not insulting you; I’m describing you.



I’d give you a nasty look, but you’ve already got one.



I’d say you’re the "missing link," but I’m not sure anyone is looking for you.



You’re not the light of my life; you’re the flickering bulb in a hallway I avoid.



I envy everyone who hasn't met you yet.



You have such a "punchable" personality.



I’ve seen better looking things scraped off a windshield.



You are a grey sprinkle on a rainbow cupcake.



If I wanted to hear from an idiot, I’d just talk to myself—at least the conversation would be smarter.

You’re a person of great talent. Unfortunately, being an idiot isn't a marketable skill.



I could explain it to you, but I can’t understand it for you.



Somewhere, a tree is tirelessly producing oxygen for you. I think you owe it an apology.



Your brain is like the Bermuda Triangle—information goes in, but nothing is ever found again.



You’re proof that even the most advanced evolution can have a glitch.



If your brain were dynamite, you wouldn’t have enough to blow your nose.



I’d love to see things from your perspective, but I can’t get my head that far up my own ego.



You are a visual representation of the word "mediocre."



Your IQ is so low you probably need to be watered twice a week.



I’ve met rocks with more intellectual curiosity than you.

You are the human equivalent of a participation trophy.



Every time you open your mouth, you prove your critics right.



If I had a face like yours, I’d sue my parents for property damage.



You’re the reason the "mute" button was invented.



People like you are the reason I prefer dogs.



You’re like the "Skip Ad" button, but in real life.



You don’t have a personality; you have a collection of symptoms.



Looking at you makes me realize how much patience your friends must have.



You’re the "Before" picture in a mental health awareness ad.



Your life is basically a cautionary tale for people who aim too low.

Deep down, you’re even more shallow than you look.



Your presence makes everyone else appreciate their own lives more.



I’m not saying I hate you, but if you were on fire and I had water, I’d drink it.



You are the physical manifestation of a "seen" message.



It’s a shame you can’t Photoshop your personality.



You’re not a main character; you’re the guy who dies in the opening credits to show how dangerous the villain is.



If you were any more boring, you’d be a PowerPoint presentation on taxes.



You’re like the 'low battery' sound—annoying and a sign that things are about to go dark.



You don't have haters; you have people who are tired of your nonsense.



Your parents should have stayed as friends.

You’re a waste of space and time.



Even an onion wouldn’t make me cry as much as your life story.



You’re the reason God doesn't talk to us anymore.



Your existence is a typo.



You are the "Terms and Conditions" that nobody reads.



If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person on earth.



You’re as useful as a screen door on a submarine.



You’re the "Reply All" of human beings.



I’ve had more interesting conversations with my toaster.



You’re just... a lot of work for very little reward.
